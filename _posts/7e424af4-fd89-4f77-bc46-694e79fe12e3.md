CSS is like the stylist for a website! üíá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è It stands for Cascading Style Sheets, but don't worry about the fancy name. Think of CSS as the fashion designer that makes web pages look pretty and stylish.

When you visit a website, you'll notice things like colors, fonts, and layouts that make it visually appealing. That's all thanks to CSS! It's the magic wand that controls how everything looks on a webpage.

So, while HTML gives the structure to a webpage, CSS adds the flair! It's what makes text bold, buttons colorful, and images beautifully arranged.

Next time you're admiring a well-designed website, remember that CSS is the fashion guru making it look so trendy and fabulous! üíÖ
