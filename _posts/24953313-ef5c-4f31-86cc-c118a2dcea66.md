title: What is Javascript?
tagline: Javascript definition
preview: "JavaScript is like the magic wand of the internet! \U0001FA84 It's a special language that makes websites do cool stuff. Imagine you're visiting a website and you click on a button to make something happen - like a pop-up window appears or an image changes when you hover over it. That's all thanks to JavaScript!"

JavaScript is like the magic wand of the internet!  It's a special language that makes websites do cool stuff. Imagine you're visiting a website and you click on a button to make something happen - like a pop-up window appears or an image changes when you hover over it. That's all thanks to JavaScript!

It's like the behind-the-scenes magician that adds interactivity and makes websites more fun and engaging. Without JavaScript, websites would be pretty static and boring, like reading a book that you can't interact with.

So, next time you see something cool happening on a website, remember, it's probably JavaScript working its magic! âœ¨
