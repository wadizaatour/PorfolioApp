HTML is like the building blocks of a website! üèóÔ∏è It stands for HyperText Markup Language, but you don't need to remember that big name. Think of HTML as the skeleton that gives structure to web pages.

When you visit a website, what you see on the screen - the text, images, buttons, and links - all come together because of HTML. It's like a blueprint that tells your web browser how to arrange everything.

So, when a web developer creates a webpage, they use HTML to tell the browser what content to show and how to display it. It's the foundation of every website you visit!

Next time you're browsing the web, remember that HTML is the secret sauce making everything look so neat and organized! üåü
